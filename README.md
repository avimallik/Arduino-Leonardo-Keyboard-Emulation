# Arduino Leonardo Keyboard Automation

this is an Arduino Leonardo (Micro Controller) Codes. i write this code for keyboard emulation. an android mobile application is sends values to the bluetooth module which is
connected to the arduino leonardo and then the arduino receives this value from bluetooth module and converts them into a keyborad instruction which is generally called.

<b> This Code help to makes a wireless bridge between Your android device and Arduino to control your game by an Android application </b> </br>

ASCII Values of keyborad <br/><br/>

<b> The KeyBoardAutomation.ino is the Main File </b> </br>

Upload the KeyBoardAutomation.ino file in your arduino Leonardo. </br>

<b> Must use Arduino Leonardo only this Microcontroller is capable to Emulates the Keyboard instruction </b> </br>
