this is an Arduino Leonardo (Micro Controller) Codes. i write this code for keyboard emulation. an android mobile application which is Developed by Me Named <b>"ArmDuino"</b> is sends values to the bluetooth module which is
connected to the arduino leonardo and then the arduino receives this value from bluetooth module and converts them into a keyborad instruction which is generally called ASCII Values of keyborad <br/><br/>

<b> This Code help to makes a wireless bridge between Your android device and Arduino to control your game by an Android application </b> </br>


<b> The KeyBoardAutomation.ino is the Main File </b> </br>

Upload the KeyBoardAutomation.ino file in your arduino Leonardo. </br>

<b> Must use Arduino Leonardo only this Microcontroller is capable to Emulates the Keyboard instruction </b> </br>
